## The VGER Groups Architecture Guidelines

### What is this?
Architecture documents and templates are essential to people being able to deliver in a manor that works for a company.
Be they employees, contractors, local, distributed, overseas, remote. 

At The VGER Group we want to help facilitate groups being able to develop their own architecture, so we're opening up 
our guidelines for Architecture, and have provided a template for creating your own.

The guidelines are focused on technology and processes for engineering and running services mostly cloud driven.
We look at open source, and commercial solutions that solve niche problems, and provide the thinking behind the guidelines. 


### What this is not
This is not a guide on UX / UI Frameworks, mainly because they change too frequently and are tied more directly to the 
skill sets of those who are providing those solutions. 


### How to use

Review the [Architecture Guidelines](Architecture_guidelines.md), for the sections that you are most interested in. 
Fill out the [Architecture Template](Architecture_Template.md), and document what you currently have.

For sections that you are unsure about, go back and review the guidelines document.
