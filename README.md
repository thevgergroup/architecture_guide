### What is this?
[Architecture Guidelines](Architecture_guidelines.md) and [templates](Architecture_Template.md) are essential to people being able to deliver in a manor that works for a company. However Architectures can be difficult to generate, and hard to get buy in. 

Out goal is to help facilitate groups being able to develop their own architecture, understand the thought process behind it and build consensus within a team or an organization. 

The guidelines are focused on technology and processes for engineering and running services mostly cloud driven.
We look at open source solutions, and commercial solutions that solve niche problems, and provide recommendations on why to use them.

### What this is not
This is not a guide on UX / UI Frameworks, mainly because those frameworks change too frequently

### How to use

Review the [Architecture Guidelines](Architecture_guidelines.md), for the sections that you are most interested in. 
Fill out the [Architecture Template](Architecture_Template.md), and document what you currently have.

For sections that you are unsure about, go back and review the guidelines document.
